# TTS-Mood

Minimal web application that records microphone audio, transcribes speech using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, and analyzes the mood of the transcript using a Google LLM (Gemini), then saves it on Firestore.

---

## What the application does

1. Records microphone audio in the browser.
2. Uploads the audio to a Python backend.
3. Transcribes speech using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
4. Sends the transcript to Gemini for mood analysis.
5. Stores the transcript and mood result in Firestore.
6. Returns the transcript and mood to the browser for display.

## Mood analysis

The mood analysis step uses a large language model to classify the overall emotional tone of the transcript.

The model returns structured JSON that includes:
- a mood label
- a confidence score between 0 and 1
- optional evidence phrases extracted from the transcript
